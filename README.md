## 🧭 Business Objectives
- ✅ **Identify high-potential regions** using GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) benchmarking  
- ✅ **Assess resource stability** through distribution analysis (box plots) and variability metrics  
- ✅ **Evaluate operational risk** via temperature trends, peak sun hours, and extreme value detection  
- ✅ **Prioritize investments** using country-level rankings and key performance indicators (KPIs)  
- ✅ **Support ESG & sustainability goals** with transparent, visual, and statistically validated insights
